As a Frontend Developer at Netcentric I have participated in two projects, the first is the creation of the new "Miles and More" portal, in which I was part of a team of more than 25 people and where we use different technologies and collaborative tools such as:

- PostCSS and Sass
- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
- Atlassian Suite (Bitbucket, Confluence, Jira)

And also participate in an email marketing campaign for Direct Line for Business creating templates from scratch and using tools such as litmus and Adobe Campaign
