Unfortunately this company prefers to keep its projects private but I can say that I have participated in projects developed with JAMSTACK and others with Grav CMS. My tasks consisted of developing from scratch, creating reusable modules, making improvements in the performance of the sites, developing libraries to share with other projects, implementing testing with the VWO tool, using webpack to compile files, using SASS as a css preprocessor and many other things.
