        <p>After graduating in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> I moved to Barcelona where I have worked on projects as a freelancer and in <strong>small and large companies</strong> with teams of up to 30 people.</p>
        <p>A normal day consists of organizing myself with my team based on an <strong>agile development methodology</strong>, developing reusable components, developing <strong>end-to-end tests</strong>, automating tasks, documenting, taking care of performance based on Google's <strong>Web Vitals</strong>, doing code review, having always in mind the principles <strong>SOLID, DRY and KISS</strong> and of course having fun with my colleagues.</p>
        <p>The tools of my day to day are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Atlassian suit (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket)</li>
          <li>Git</li>
          <li>Zeplin / Sketch</li>
          <li>Javascript (Vanilla, JQuery, React, etc)</li>
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS (Bootstrap, SASS and PostCSS Preprocessors)</li>
          <li>Webpack</li>
          <li>VWO (For testing)</li>
          <li>Gatsby (JAMSTACK)</li>
          <li>Firebase</li>
          <li>Netlify</li>
          <li>... and more things I don't remember &#128513;</li>
